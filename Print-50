/*This is a program that prints numbers from 1 to 50. But the program only runs correctly when we use for loop otherwise in if loop it doesn't shows anything except 1,
which is assinged to the variable 'a' and on the other hand the while loop also doesn't show the output properly.


#include<stdio.h>

int main()

{   int a = 1;
    cout<<" The numbers from 1 to 50 are: ";
    //while(a<=50)
   //if(a<=50)
    //for(a = 1; a<=50; a++)
    {
        cout<<"\n"<<a;
        //a++;
    }
    return 0;
}
